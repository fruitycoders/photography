# Photography Webpage
This website shows the history of photography such as famous photographers. It explains the background of these famous photographers and their role in helping advance photography to become what it is in this day and age.

## Overview
- This website is intended to help the developers learn more about html, css, javascript and jinja and bootstrap
- This website allows viewers to view photos and learn information about photography.

## Log
- Nov 28: Updated playground.html, history.html, and data.py to make use of Jinja.
- Nov 27: Linda and Sophie updated the code to contain more data and loops using Jinja. Added a new file (playground.html) and used Jinja base templates, including {% endblock %} and {% block head %}, to display our data.
- Nov 17-20: because of Linda's household's router settings, had to go through other extra steps to port forward pi web server for it to be accessed from Internet. Contacted tp-link and eastlink service agents, made the router to bridge mode and applied other administrative settings to find the public internet ip address. 
- Nov 16: deployed local area connection, now able to run raspberry pi web server in any browser with a local network. 
- Nov 15: Connected the raspberry pi on home monitor, installed VNC and set up RealVNC to share remote connection. 
- Nov 13: Cleaned up website and fixed any formatting errors or anything we had wanted to change
- Nov 12: Picked up Rasberry pi from teacher and we started to deploy our project
- Nov 9: Talked about deploying our project and that we can get a rasberry pi from the teacher. 
- Nov 5: Fixed some formatting errors on our website
- Nov 4: Learned that we would need to deploy our project so we did research to figure out how since none of us had a rasberry pi
- Nov 3: Linda got Jinja to work, so we are now moving the Repl code to IntelliJ
- Oct 30: Changed project so it is about photography history instead of a place to upload photos. Sophie changed the main design of the site, linked the pages to each other, added a drop down menu for the gallery link. Also created the pages for History, Biographies, Gallery, and About Us. Team members also wrote the mini biographies of two photographers.
- Oct 29: Maggie linked website to IntelliJ and updated the README file. Team also made minor changes to html
- Oct 28: Linked Github and Jinja to the code
- Oct 23: Maggie added the first photo to the webpage!
- Oct 22: Adam worked on updating README.md
- Oct 21: Sophie changed the format of the homepage heading
- Oct 20: We updated the titles and link names to fit our plans for the website.
- Oct 19: Started the photography website where we upload photos

## Pages
- Home : This is the initial page that viewers will see. Here, they will see an overview of the website and peaks at photo features. From here, viewers can navigate to other pages.
- Gallery : This is the page where all photos are displayed in a gridlike assembly.
- Share : This is the page where viewers can upload their photos and additional information to be featured on the website.
- About Us : This page explains explains who we are the purpose of this project

## Overview Of Provided Code
- main.py : code that incorporates Flask and routes to other files
- home.html : code for the home page
- README.md : required "readme" file

## Web Development with Flask
1. Frontend: HTML, Jinja (Templates, For Loops, Conditionals), Routes (view)
2. Backend: Running Server, Python data (model)
3. Deploy: Self Hosting

| Unit | Percentage | Hello Series usage |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Big Idea 1: Creative Computing | 10-13% | Students will build a Web Site Portfolio and Team Project(S) according to their own interests |
|  Big Idea 2: Data | 17-22% | Student will define and establish data definitions in Python. They will use "backend" Python data in "frontend" to be rendered via HTML. |
|  Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming | 30-35% | Students will engage in defining Python dictionaries, organizing data, and processing data on HTML pages.  Students will learn HTML makrup, Jinja templates, and Jinja/Python logic |
|  Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Network | 11-15% | Students by Self Hosting a Web server on a Raspberry Pi will learn about system processes and network protocols (HTTP).  Students will enable Flask, Gunicorn, Nginx processes on a Self-Hosted-Web server.  Students will learn how a system (web server) responds to GET and POST HTTP events.  |
|  Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing | 21-26% |  Students will learn how a Web Server can provide opportunity to share information via N@tM activity.   This Web Server will enable students opportunities for personal information sharing, around the globe. |
